## 📌 Problem Statement

Modern personalization systems rely on **personally identifiable information (PII)** and **cookies** — practices that are increasingly restricted due to privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and technical limitations (cookie deprecation).

**PrivyPersona** enables websites to:
- Learn user **intent** and **demographics**
- Suggest content or layout changes
- Do all of this **without tracking, cookies, or PII**
